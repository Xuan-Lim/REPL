# Applying to the University of London Bachelors of Computer Science degree (UoL)  

UoL has a [long, esteemed history of administering reputable distance learning degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_London_Worldwide), though information about their new BSc Computer Science is spare due to its being new. This documentation seeks to explain the process behind applying in a concise and clear way so you know exactly what to expect when you do it yourself.

## Administrative Information: Admissions Process and Requirements

Students may apply to the programme in two of the following ways: Direct Admissions (where you are admitted to study as conventionally expecte) and Performance-based Admissions (often used as an alternative route to getting admitted if you did not meet the academic requirements). Regardless of which route you would be falling under, you must meet an equivalent of three requirements for your track:

1. The entry requirements for your track of admissions
2. BSc Comp Sci's specific requirements of Maths at the appropreate level
3. [English Requirements](#english-requirements-for-non-english-speaking-countries)

For Direct Admissions: General Requirements must be met - your country's equivalent can be found here: https://london.ac.uk/entrance-qualifications

For Performance-Based Admissions: your requirements can be found here: https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london/admissions

If you're not sure which track you'll fall under - or whether or not you will be able to obtain admissions, UOL's general advice is to apply early and to apply anyway (see [Application Process](#application-process))

### English Requirements for Non-English Speaking Countries

Every student, English-speaking country or not must prove their proficiency in English before applying. This is often proven by native English speakers by showing that you were educated in English. For those who were not educated in English, you must show that you have [proficiency at the standards stated here](https://london.ac.uk/applications/how-apply/english-requirements#awards-2563)

### Documents and Statement to Prepare for Application

If you're familiar with the British UCAS system, which students use
after sixth form (12/13th Grade) apply to university, the application is fairly similar. The only difference being that you're applying to one university and not five.

In the application you will be asked to supply them with the following things. I would suggest having these prepared beforehand (especially academic documents) to ensure that your application decisions come in as smoothly as possible:

1. A scanned copy of your ID
2. A verfied copy of the Academic Documents that back your meeting the requirements for the programme
3. A 100-250 word Personal Statement (of prompt: "Why do you wish to study for this programme?
Please give your reasons, you should include details about your education, work experience and current responsibilities, which are relevant to this application.")

It is worth noting that you need not have the verified copy completed before application. That being said, providing verification can be the most tedious part of the application process - getting this done before a high volume applications season can benefit you as a result. [Here is some guidance from the university on how you can get this done.](https://london.ac.uk/applications/how-apply/supplying-evidence)

## Application Process

Upon submission of the application, you will be assigned to an admissions advisor who goes through your qualifications and gives you advice on whether or not they can admit you.

Students unsure of whether or not they meet the requirements for application should apply anyway to see if they can enter the programme. Likewise, those without verified copies at the time of application should apply to gain a decision made on their application, that becomes granted contingent on their documented evidence being verified.

The link here documents the process very clearly on what to expect next: https://london.ac.uk/applicationshow-apply/what-happens-next

A reality keen applicants and prospective students should know: the admissions office, those in charge of education, or help in general can be slow. I would advise everyone interested in applying to apply as soon as possible.

## Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) Application

RPL is the exemption of modules taken if you had taken it before in a prior diploma or university. It can be seen as a form of credit transfer. Full regulations can be found in the [course regulations](https://london.ac.uk/sites/default/files/regulations/progregs-computer-science-2019-2020.pdf). Grades attained from the programme will not be transferred, however a listing of the grade will be written on your transcript.

You will have stated your intention to apply for RPL in your application form, and upon acceptance you will have been given detailed instructions on how to go about submitting proof for RPL.

There is cost and limitations involved, currently it costs 392 GBP to get all 8 modules from the first year exempted. Likewise, you are only able to get first year modules exempted.

You can get RPL credit in 3 of the following ways:

1. [Automatic RPL: You hold a diploma from these colleges/are transferring from one of UoL's on-campus programmes](https://london.ac.uk/applications/how-apply/recognition-prior-learning/recognition-and-accreditation-prior-learning-3)
2. [Discretionary RPL: You have a diploma/incomplete degree you would like the programme director to consider for RPL](https://london.ac.uk/applications/how-apply/recognition-prior-learning/recognition-and-accreditation-prior-learning-3)
3. [Google's IT Diploma: You completed the course and would like the HCW exemption](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support)

RPL from a discretionary route will take awhile, students have reported the process taking a full month before the process was complete. It would be wise to apply as soon as possible to avoid delays with module registration.
